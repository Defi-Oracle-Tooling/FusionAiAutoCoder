# FusionAiAutoCoder Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides detailed implementation instructions for the FusionAiAutoCoder project, an Agentic IDE designed to accelerate code development through multi-agent AI processes.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer**: Built on AutoGen framework
- **Azure AI Foundry Integration**: For offloading specialized AI tasks
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Using Terraform for Azure provisioning
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for continuous deployment

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Development Environment Setup
1. Provision development VM using Terraform configuration
2. Install VS Code Insiders and the AI Toolkit plugin
3. Set up ONNX Runtime and/or Ollama for local model execution
4. Configure AutoGen for multi-agent orchestration

### 2. Agent Implementation
1. Define specialized agents:
   - **Code Review Agent**: Reviews code for best practices and potential issues.
   - **Security Analysis Agent**: Analyzes code for security vulnerabilities and compliance.
2. Configure communication patterns between agents.
3. Implement task routing logic for hybrid workflows.
4. Set up error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### 3. Infrastructure Deployment
1. Provision AKS cluster with specialized node pools:
   - GPU node pool (NCads_H100_v5) for intensive workloads
   - General compute node pool (DSv3) for API and service components
   - Memory-optimized node pool (M Series) for data processing tasks
2. Configure auto-scaling policies
3. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
4. Implement cost management controls

### 4. Azure AI Foundry Integration
1. Establish secure connections using Azure AD and managed identities
2. Implement hybrid workflows that combine local and cloud AI capabilities
3. Create task dispatching logic based on computational requirements
4. Set up performance monitoring for optimization

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
1. Configure GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing
2. Set up deployment pipelines for infrastructure and application code
3. Implement quality gates and approval processes
4. Establish monitoring for deployment health
