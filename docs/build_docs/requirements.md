# Azure Deployment Requirements for Auto Coding System

This document details the requirements for deploying a robust, scalable, and cost-efficient auto coding system on Azure. It covers compute quota management, SKU selection, network/security, integration strategies (including Azure AI Foundry), and cost management.

---

## 1. Dev Box Deployment
- **Environment:** Host a development environment on Azure that seamlessly connects to the primary compute resources.
- **Hibernation:** Ensure the dev box supports hibernation to reduce costs during idle periods.
- **Recommended Instances:** Use Standard_B or DSv3 instances coupled with Premium SSD storage to balance performance and cost.

---

## 2. Compute Quota Requirements & SKU Selection

### A. Primary GPU-Intensive Workloads
- **SKU:** Standard NCads_H100_v5  
  - **Purpose:** Dedicated for heavy AI processing (e.g., model fine-tuning, auto coding tasks, large-scale inference).
  - **Quota:** Current quota limit of **1440 vCores**.
  - **Region:** Exclusively available in the West Europe region.
  - **Hardware Details:**
    - Equipped with advanced GPU accelerators.
    - Recommended memory: 256–512 GiB per instance.
    - High-speed NVMe or Ultra SSD storage is recommended for temporary data buffering during model training.
  - **Networking:** High throughput network interfaces; configure accelerated networking if available.
  - **Hibernation:** Must support hibernation for cost optimization during non-peak hours.
  - **Cost Insight:** Estimated at ~**$4.50 per vCore-hour**; full utilization (1440 vCores) could cost up to ~$6,480 per hour. Optimized usage through auto-scaling and hibernation will reduce actual expenditure.

### B. Additional SKUs for Complementary Workloads

- **B Series (Burstable Instances):**
  - **Purpose:** Best suited for CI/CD, low-cost development boxes, and light testing environments.
  - **Instance Details:**
    - Lower vCore counts (1–4 vCores) with burstable CPU performance.
    - Use Standard or Premium SSDs based on performance need.
    - Memory options: 2–16 GiB.
  - **Cost:** Approximately **$0.05 to $0.15 per vCore-hour**.
  - **Hibernation:** Required.

- **DSv3 Series (General-Purpose VMs):**
  - **Purpose:** Ideal for production workloads such as web servers, API endpoints, and general compute tasks.
  - **Instance Details:**
    - Configurations typically range from 4–8 vCores per instance.
    - Storage: Standard to Premium SSDs; memory up to 32–64 GiB.
    - Provides good network performance for web-facing applications.
  - **Cost:** Approximately **$0.20 to $0.50 per vCore-hour**.
  - **Hibernation:** Required.

- **M Series (Memory-Optimized VMs):**
  - **Purpose:** Designed for memory-intensive operations such as in-memory caching, large-scale data processing, and analytics.
  - **Instance Details:**
    - High memory-to-vCore ratios (e.g., 16 vCores with 256 GiB+ memory).
    - Supports high-performance storage solutions with Premium/Ultra SSDs.
  - **Cost:** Approximately **$0.30 to $0.70 per vCore-hour**.
  - **Hibernation:** Required.

> **Note:** When planning additional quotas, factor in storage (Premium/Ultra SSD), memory, and networking settings for each SKU. All instances must be hibernation-capable to minimize idle costs and support flexible scaling.
