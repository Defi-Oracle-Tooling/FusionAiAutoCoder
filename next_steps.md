Here are the next implementation steps:

- **Finalize Architecture & Documentation:**  
  - Review and validate the refined requirements with stakeholders.  
  - Update architectural diagrams and process flow based on the current blueprint.

- **Provision Infrastructure Using IaC:**  
  - Develop and test ARM templates/Bicep or Terraform scripts to automate resource provisioning (Dev Box, GPU instances, DSv3, M, and B Series).  
  - Set up budgeting, tagging, and cost alerts via Azure Cost Management.

- **Deploy and Configure Core Resources:**  
  - Spin up the development environment and production resources, ensuring all instances have hibernation enabled.  
  - Verify network setups (VNets, NSGs, VPN/ExpressRoute) for secure connectivity.

- **Integrate Azure AI Foundry:**  
  - Set up authentication (via Azure AD and managed identities) for AI Foundry endpoints.
  - Develop a proof-of-concept to route specific AI tasks (e.g., language understanding, image processing) to AI Foundry services.
  - Configure hybrid workflows for offloading non-GPU intensive tasks.

- **Implement Monitoring & Diagnostics:**  
  - Deploy Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics for end-to-end tracking.
  - Configure alerts for critical thresholds (resource usage, quota, and compliance).

- **Containerization & Orchestration:**  
  - Set up an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with dedicated node pools based on GPU and general compute workloads.
  - Implement auto-scaling and load balancing for optimized resource allocation.

- **Testing & Cost Optimization:**  
  - Conduct functional and performance testing of the auto coding system.
  - Validate auto-scaling, hibernation, and cost management strategies.
  - Pilot a full workflow, then adjust resource distribution as necessary.

- **Team Enablement & Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Train team members on both the deployment process and Azure AI Foundry integration.
  - Establish documentation, feedback loops, and process improvement routines.

- **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines:**
  - Configure GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment.
  - Add documentation for CI/CD setup and usage.

- **Enhance Source Files:**
  - Add meaningful examples or templates in `src/main.py` and `src/utils.py`.

- **Expand Test Coverage:**
  - Add test cases for CI/CD setup validation.

- **Refine Documentation:**
  - Update `README.md` and `docs/usage.md` with detailed instructions.

Following these steps will help you build, deploy, and optimize your auto coding system in a scalable and cost-efficient manner on Azure.
